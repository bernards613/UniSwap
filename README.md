## Project Description
UniSwap is a web-based marketplace designed for Oakland University students who are looking to buy or sell dorm-related items. This is mainly useful during the move-in and move-out periods during college, when students are looking to get new items or sell old ones. The main idea for the application is to allow local on-campus exchanges for students living on campus.
